# My Portfolio

_Check out my portfolio [here](http://jon-samp.com)._

This is my portfolio. It is really simple, and might not technically qualify as a 'portfolio' in the traditional sense. I could make a lot of fancy transitions, with big photos that slide across the screen of work I've done, but I've decided not to. You can check out this GitHub, or scroll through my Twitter to see my work.

Instead, my goal with this portfolio is to show you *who I am*. That's awfully hard to do with only showing you my work.

So, I've included one of my interests: photography. You'll also see my life, week by week. It was inspired by [this article](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).


## Technologies
This is made with AngularJS, one of my favorite frameworks to work with. I also generated most of the project with Yeoman's [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular). If you haven't checked out Yeoman, it teleports you to the fun part of coding.

Also, this app is built and served with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

## What the dog?
If you check out the site, you'll see that I am thinking about getting a dog.

If you have guidance/advice, I'd love to hear it. Reach out to me on Twitter: @JonSamp.
